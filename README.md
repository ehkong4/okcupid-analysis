# Analyzing Demographic Differences in OKCupid Dating Profiles
This repository contains data and analysis from the public profiles of users on an online dating site, OKCupid. 

## Data
Our dataset, `okcupid_profiles.csv` was collected on 6/30/12 and consists of almost 60,000 profiles within a 25 mile radius of San Francisco. There are 30 covariates including personâ€™s age, drinking preferences, height, education level, and dating preferences for anyone who had logged in within the last year of the date of the data pull.

## Analysis
The analysis is contained in [this notebook](okcupid-analysis.ipynb). We study demographic differences between the male and female populations and determine if gender correlates to any of our covariates.
